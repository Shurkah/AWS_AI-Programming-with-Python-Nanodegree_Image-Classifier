# AWS_AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree_Image-Classifier
The task was to train an image classifier that categorizes flowers into 102 categories by using a deep learning neural network

The original data used to train the network came from the 102 Category Flower Dataset that can be viewed here: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
The dataset was split into three parts, training, validation, and testing. 

The checkpoint file couldn't be uploaded as it is 35.2 MB (GitHub limit is 25 MB), but there are functions in the program that allow to generate a new one as you train the network.
